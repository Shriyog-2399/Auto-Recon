# Auto-Recon
This bash script automates the process of reconnaissance and scanning for a given domain. It sequentially runs tools like subfinder, amass, dnsx, httpx, and naabu to discover subdomains, resolve DNS records, filter accessible endpoints, and perform a port scan. The results are saved in separate files for further analysis.
